# go routines

In simple terms, a Go routine is a lightweight thread of execution in the Go programming language. It allows you to execute concurrent and parallel operations within a single program.

Go routines are different from traditional threads in that they are not managed by the operating system but by the Go runtime itself. This means that they can be created and destroyed quickly and efficiently, without the overhead typically associated with creating threads.

In Go, you can create a new Go routine by using the "go" keyword followed by a function call. The function call will be executed in a separate Go routine, allowing you to perform concurrent operations without blocking the main program.

For example:
```
func main() {
    go someFunction() // create a new Go routine to execute someFunction()
    // do other things
}

func someFunction() {
    // perform some operation
}
```

# why we need go routines

Go routines are useful because they allow you to write concurrent and parallel programs in a simpler and more efficient way.

Concurrent programming is important because many programs need to perform multiple tasks at the same time. For example, a web server might need to handle multiple requests simultaneously, or a game engine might need to update the game world while processing player input. By using Go routines, you can write code that executes multiple tasks concurrently, without blocking the main program or other Go routines.

Parallel programming is also important because it allows you to take advantage of multi-core CPUs to perform tasks faster. By using Go routines, you can create multiple threads of execution that can run in parallel on different CPU cores. This can significantly improve the performance of your program, especially when dealing with computationally intensive tasks.

In addition to being useful for concurrent and parallel programming, Go routines are also lightweight and efficient. Creating and managing Go routines is much faster and consumes less memory than creating and managing traditional threads, making them a good choice for high-performance applications.

Overall, Go routines are an essential feature of the Go programming language that enable concurrent and parallel programming in a simple and efficient way.
